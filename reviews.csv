2018-12-31,Roma,2018,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/roma-2018/,,,"The birth scene was so weird to me, in fact I laughed out loud. In 2 mins she goes through: crowning, delivery, placenta, stitches, infant CPR, and the ""we did everything we could"" speech. It felt like a Monty Python sketch, and out of place. 

That aside, still a very enjoyable experience. Reminded me of ""Oro, Plata, Mata.""",,2018-12-30

2019-08-26,Burning,2018,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/burning-2018/,,,"I saw Lee Chang-dong's <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/secret-sunshine/"">Secret Sunshine</a> from the Criterion Collection and loved it. In exploring his work I landed on this because it was available via Netflix.

A beautiful slow burn within which the trio of leads really shine. Steven Yeun with that damned smug smile, haha. And let's not forget that truck Jong-su drove, it was a character all its own.

Loved it.",netflix,2019-08-25
2019-08-26,Horror Noire: A History of Black Horror,2019,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/horror-noire-a-history-of-black-horror/,,,They cover practically a century of horror. It was pretty cool and I added several to my watchlist as a result.,amazon-prime,2019-08-25
2019-08-26,Wretched Lives,2001,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/wretched-lives/,,,"Wow, wretched lives indeed. Set against the backdrop of the second EDSA revolution we see Vanessa trying to navigate caring for her mentally challenged sister following the death of her mother. Depicted is a poverty stricken neighborhood plagued by police and political corruption, in which everyone is suffering.

2019-08-27,My Neighbor Totoro,1988,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/my-neighbor-totoro/,,Yes,"What's not perfect about this film? I'm an old man and I still get choked up when the little sister gets lost.

The world is a magical place as a child, it's a shame we let the magic leave us.","theatrical, ghibli-fest-2019",2019-08-26

2019-09-15,Brutal Tales of Chivalry,1965,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/brutal-tales-of-chivalry/,,,Ikebe's introduction at the Kozu-gumi house was pretty amazing. Now I've got to see the rest of the series.,bd,2019-09-15
2019-09-19,In Between Mountains And Oceans,2014,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/in-between-mountains-and-oceans/,,,"This kind of strays from the building of the Ise Jingu shrine itself, but goes on to show how they care for the forest. The rebuilding of the shrine is contrasted with the upkeep done at the 1000+ year old Hōryū-ji temple, showcasing traditional Japanese architecture and construction techniques. The doc is interspersed with interviews with artists, carpenters, activists, and more including the great Takeshi Kitano. 

Masaaki Miyazawa's photography is beyond beautiful. It is supposedly the first Japanese documentary shot in 4k - I wish I'd seen it in 4k, but the streaming version on Amazon is still stunning. 

Quite relaxing and beautiful, with a fitting score. Definitely worth the watch in my opinion.",amazon-prime,2019-09-18
2019-09-20,Walrus Yes: The Making of Tusk,2019,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/walrus-yes-the-making-of-tusk/,,,"I'm not a listener of SMODcast and really only saw Tusk on a late night whim. I thought it was horrifying in the best way, an effect perhaps amplified by the fact I went in blind. I'm one of those people that liked it.

Fast forward past Smith's widowmaker and Yoga Hosers to today and #WalrusYes. The doc starts with a bit of pre-production and then is structured basically as a daily diary of the 15 day shoot. It is interspersed with board games, a birthday cake, and other behind the scenes bits.

I found the bits we see of how Kevin is sometimes Jay's big brother to be interesting and their shared silliness genuine. Also, Kevin is endlessly generous with his praise, optimism, and overall enjoyment on set which is heartwarming in a way. This optimism is reflected in the crew and folks seem to be enjoying the work.

Overall I found it enjoyable to watch right after work and it made me laugh - which isn't always easy.",youtube,2019-09-20
2019-09-24,Rambo: Last Blood,2019,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/rambo-last-blood/,,,"I laughed at this the whole time. It seemed ripe for memes.

As many times as I have seen this, I have never brought myself to read the book. I should amend that.","theatrical, remastered",2019-10-01

2019-10-13,El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie/,,,"A satisfying, yet almost too happy, ending for Jesse Pinkman. I'm not convinced it works as a movie so much as a short continuation of the show to give this character some closure.

The dynamic between Skinny Pete, Badger, and Jesse stole the show for me.",netflix,2019-10-12
2019-10-15,Roundhay Garden Scene,1888,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/roundhay-garden-scene/,,,"It's funny to think that many do, or have done, the same thing when getting a new camera, or by today's standards, a phone: we point it at nearby people and start recording. 

I wonder if they got dressed up first or talked about what they should do.",youtube,2019-10-15

2019-10-24,Nosferatu,1922,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/nosferatu/,,,"I started with the 80 minute version included with Amazon Prime because, well, it is free - which is pretty rough all around (scratched dirty print, cropped title cards, characters renamed in the title cards, missing footage, etc.). I switched over to the Kino restored version which includes some missing and lost scenes as well as an orchestral soundtrack. The picture on the restored one is several orders of magnitude better, however there was noticable interlacing anytime there's fast motion, at least on Amazon Prime.

Overall was creepy and fun. Nothing I could say would be more informative or interesting than decades of reviews and analysis already out there. Reminder to check which version you're watching before starting.",amazon-prime,2019-10-23
