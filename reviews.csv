The rebuilding of the shrine is contrasted with the upkeep done at the 1000+ year old Hōryū-ji temple, showcasing traditional Japanese architecture and construction techniques. The doc is interspersed with interviews with artists, carpenters, activists, and more including the great Takeshi Kitano. 

Masaaki Miyazawa's photography is beyond beautiful. It is supposedly the first Japanese documentary shot in 4k - I wish I'd seen it in 4k, but the streaming version on Amazon is still stunning.

Fast forward past Smith's widowmaker and Yoga Hosers to today and #WalrusYes. The doc starts with a bit of pre-production and then is structured basically as a daily diary of the 15 day shoot. It is interspersed with board games, a birthday cake, and other behind the scenes bits.

I found the bits we see of how Kevin is sometimes Jay's big brother to be interesting and their shared silliness genuine. Also, Kevin is endlessly generous with his praise, optimism, and overall enjoyment on set which is heartwarming in a way. This optimism is reflected in the crew and folks seem to be enjoying the work.

The picture on the restored one is several orders of magnitude better, however there was noticable interlacing anytime there's fast motion, at least on Amazon Prime.

2019-12-24,Cats,2019,https://boxd.it/UvYFf,,,"The temptation to see this before any sort of patch was too great. Theoretically this version will never appear on streaming or disc, so I went out immediately. 

That being said about the patch, I don't think my complaints beyond it looking silly, especially the hands, are dependent on any sort of patch. In addition to that, I've never seen the stage musical so I'm not sure where the film stops and the stage play begins.

The practically nonexistent plot gives way to a series of musical dance numbers, which itself is an interesting idea. The problem for me was two-fold: 

1. The songs are mostly nonsensical. This may not be an issue per se, but when paired with #2 makes the movie mostly bad CG cats with human faces looking at the screen.

2. Camera and editing that minimizes the dancing! This part kills me because, at least theoretically in my mind, cat-like agility and dance-like movement could lend itself to some really beautiful choreography. It was almost all swallowed up with waist-up closeups and quick cuts that never give the choreography time to shine.  If the choreography was prioritized then the songs may have had more mpact. 

I wasn't exactly expecting The Red Shoes, but we've come so far technology-wise that this movie is borderline criminal.

On the upside, 2 of the songs were enjoyable and I could see them being moving outside of the film, but then again those songs were probably there in the original? I'm sure someone knows.

Ultimately I couldn't recommend this, I'd suggest seeing one of the televised or recorded stage productions instead... and I haven't even seen them.","theatrical, pre-patch, regal-unlimited",2019-12-23

Great movie as always, and the commentary was super interesting.

Today I learned:
 - Jackie Chan has a big head.
 - Eric Tsang started as a stuntman.
 - Minibuses were/are a unique travel option in Hong Kong. They are often operated by folks from Chaochou and have a reputation for being connected with the Triad. ""7-Eleven"" was some kind of derogatory term for them, I'm not clear what it means exactly though.
 - Undercranking is a thing. It was used by Sammo and other directors of the period but needs to be done well for it to look good. More to learn on that.
 - The Lucky Stars movie series was started by Golden Harvest in response to a series being done by a competitor at the time
 - My Lucky Stars was released for Chinese New Year 1985 and was filmed during the winter of 1984 - hence the jackets they are wearing in the Japanese locations.
 - Filming on the sequel, Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars, was already going on during filming of My Lucky Stars and it released just a few months later in summer 1985.
 - Supercop was the first Hong Kong film in decades to film with real sound.
 - Sibelle Hu did so well that they formed a new movie series called ""The Inspector Wears Skirts"" where she reprises her role as Madam Wu.
 - Only 3 of the actors dub their own voices in the film including Stanley Shui-Fan Fung and Richard Ng. Evidently the contracts of some Hong Kong actors at the time stipulated that they be the only ones who dub their own voice - they considered it part of their craft. Chow Yun-Fat was another actor of the time whose contracts required that he dub his own work.
 - Sammo Hung's voice is dubbed by the actor who dubbed Doraemon's voice in Cantonese at the time
 - Michiko Nishiwaki was a body builder and power lifter at the time

I would have loved to see the costumes, the custom furniture, the ceilings, everything over the course of a mini-series or proper television series. Some parts we're only there for a scene or two, like the library.  Anyway, beyond the amazing set design and costumes... the story itself and the way it unfolds isn't particular interesting or entertaining imho.  What feels like it was supposed to be a twist comes sooner than expected, and the paranormal component seem to be completely unnecessary.  All that said, it didn't feel like a waste of time, so much as a missed opportunity.

It succeeds at being fairly relatable: being stuck at work or alone with nothing but strangers to greet you. It also sticks to real earthly horrors, making it believable and possible.

The ""mask"" is a lot creepier than one would expect, so too is Edith Scob's performance as the once beautiful ""caged bird"" Christiane. On one side we see a father's ""love"" and what he's willing to do for it, but on the flip side it doesn't feel like love, it feels like a father's inability to let go.  Like a bird in a cage, Christiane has nowhere to go, no one to confide in, and no way out as we watch the horrors perpetrated by her father and his misguided assistant. Relatable in the way we can find ourselves trapped in our relationships and with those we love.

It comes across a lot more dreamlike and atmospheric than sticking to its plot.  It feels a bit experimental, but then again I guess all films were experimental as things transitioned into the world of sound.  I really liked the desynchronized shadow and I will certainly remember the view from the coffin window as it is carried through the village!

This joint had a good mixture of weird, sexy, dreamlike violence imho. But the question is... where is Daphne? That waitress Doris is always talking about Daphne but we never see her? The pills come from Daphne's doctor, and yet Doris is the one giving them to Molly. Daphne never appears on screen, she doesn't even appear in the credits. Are there theories about her? I need to know.

I found myself thinking the laboratory set was pretty awesome. I especially liked how the unique window and acid bath came into play a few different ways: getting rid of the original head, Elizabeth catching a glimpse of the monster, and the ultimate demise of said monster.

Frankenstein himself is self-centered and heartless in this iteration. The storyline with the maid makes him seem especially cruel. I kind of liked how casually he wiped blood on his coat in the lab, or how he dug a grave in his waistcoat, haha.

2020-10-25,[REC],2007,https://boxd.it/1qijD5,,,"I couldn't find the original Spanish language version on Amazon.  After renting and watching ~30 seconds of the version that was available, I called and requested a refund - to which the young woman told me she would give me a ""one time exception to the no refunds policy"" for the movie I didn't watch.  I'm not sure if movies only being available as a horrible English dub, or us not being able to get refunds for something we didn't even use is worse, but that was the horror before the horror I experienced with this particular film. $5 DVD on Ebay to the rescue!

All that aside, I am not generally a fan of found footage films.  They often seem lazy to me, and a cheap way to hide or reduce production costs, but I was ready to be surprised - and surprised I was.  The commitment to keeping this as realistic as possible, like no soundtrack, and the long takes make it feel like you're there.  The editing keeps everything at a frantic pace once things get going which I also found enjoyable. There is a lot to praise here imho, but I guess what I liked the most was that they didn't make the plot overly complicated or have too many ""rules"".

Anyway, if I were to sit here and write a lot about this movie, it would be overwhelmingly positive I think, at least that's how I feel less than 24 hours after watching the credits roll.  Go see this, I will surely see it again.","dvd, hooptober, hooptober7.0",2020-10-25

They do a really good job of creating suspense to the point where half the things that appear on screen may be what kills someone.  The mystery of who, how, and when is what makes it exciting.

Sure, this isn't the same as the first movie, but why should it be?  As far as the bits I wasn't fond of, I would have left the ""news"" segments on the cutting room floor myself... and some of the English speaking sections are a little awkward, but they're in Hong Kong - the common language there between these characters would be English afaik. 

Anyway, once the team rows ashore to Incheon Port the fun begins.  There is heavy leaning on CG here, not unlike the MCU, though it is kept mostly for the driving sections.  These segments have edits that show closeups of real actors, including zombies, to keep it from becoming an anime.

Speaking of anime, the Mad Max + Drift Racing + Zombies + Anime combination was totally awesome! The redemption character arc isn't exactly ground breaking, but themes of refugeeism and xenophobia, especially due to infectious disease, feel quite timely if not explored at great depth.

2020-10-31,Oldboy,2003,https://boxd.it/1qZOst,,Yes,"This time around I watched the director commentary available on the Tartan Asia Extreme 10th Anniversary Edition.  I also watched the deleted scenes with commentary and some of the special features.  Anything I learned while watching or seemed of particular interest I took note of. As with any commentary, spoiler warnings abound.

* Choi Min-sik is a method actor
* One of the major themes in this film is time. The opening credits, with Korean letters spinning like the hands on a clock illustrate this, and the ""one way"" road sign is meant to indicate the one way direction of time.
* The ants don't mean anything.  Park Chan-wook mentions that they are cute (lolwut?), and other than that they are scary when they're all over your face - true!
* Much of the plot and a number of scenes are meant to illustrate that while Oh Dae-su's efforts are Herculean or extreme... they are ultimately fruitless (e.g. his years of tunneling through the wall end abruptly when he is released)
* Frankenstein's monster, who appears on the prison television, was a prototype for Oh Dae-su's alter ego. The final confrontation in Lee Woo-jin's highrise penthouse was meant to mirror the confrontation at the end of <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-bride-of-frankenstein/"">The Bride of Frankenstein (starring Boris Karloff)</a>
* Upon release Oh Dae-su is selfish and apathetic, this is his monstrous form.  This can be observed by his apparent lack of concern regarding the suicide, and that he stole sunglasses from woman in elevator.  He has become an ""incarnation of vengeance""
* Park regretted shooting just one of the deleted scenes,: a scene that introduces Dae-su to the prison. He felt it was unnecessary and something you would see in lesser films.
* Park Chan-wook admits he doesn't watch TV, but the idea of someone who learns everything from TV was interesting to him
* Mido's restaurant was originally named Akira as an homage to <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/director/akira-kurosawa/"">Kurosawa Akira</a>. The restaurant they found in Busan was named Mediterranean and they didn't spend money to change the sign
* The scene in Mido's restaurant sets the color palette for the rest of the film: green, purple, and black
* Eating the octopus was to show both Oh Dae-su's desire for something alive after years being accompanied only by a TV, and to illustrate his hostility for Lee Woo-jin
* Choi Min-sik is Buddhist and not supposed to eat live or raw animals, but he doesn't follow it strictly. They did 4-5 takes with the octopus 
* Dumpling eating montage: Park Chan-wook describes montage scenes as cliché and used a lot in cheap films, but brought the right energy to Oldboy in his opinion. Showing taboo elements with conventional film techniques gave a more interesting result in his opinion 
* The hallway fight scene is similar to the grand paintings of the middle ages or Renaissance with lots of people in them like those by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez"">Diego Velasquez</a>. The gang members are holding wooden sticks, he wanted them to be like knights holding lances or etc
* The hallway fight is meaningless. Another example of Oh Dae-su's gruesome efforts which ultimately have no impact on the outcome. Oh Dae-su feels more empty and alone here and asking himself ""Why do I have to do this?""
* The hallway fight was storyboarded for 100+ shots. They went for the single long take while filming
* Oh Dae-su is like a wounded beast. The working title for the film was Beast
* The schedule was so tight that Choi Min-sik fell asleep while the camera was rolling 
* Lee Woo-jin stops growing after the events at the school, and it is shown in his user id ""evergreen"". Even if he gets old he doesn't get wrinkles, much like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray"">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>. That was Park's idea of the character 
* A kiss scene was filmed to replace the sex scene for the TV release .
* When Lee Woo-jin visits them with the gas mask on in the hotel, right after the sex scene, Park found that scene to be the most offensive in this violent movie. Removing the bed sheet from her with a single finger suggests rape
* Park's intent was for the film to be more cartoonish than his others. Exaggerated and emotionally rich
* Viewers watching first vs subsequent times were considered in the casting (e.g., Mido needs to look like a baby the second time around), plotwise/editing (a line was left in insinuating that Mido may be a spy for Lee Woo-jin - but on second viewing we know he's plotted the whole thing)
* Park got the idea for the chase scene with two Dae-su's chasing a man in the past from <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/director/brian-de-palma/"">Brian de Palma</a>'s ""<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/dressed-to-kill-1980/"">Dressed to Kill</a>"". Not the past & present, but the rhythm of the editing 
* The female voice on the elevator saying ""its a wrong combination"" cross cut with the scene of Mido and Oh Dae-su hugging is telling us something is wrong with their union
* The final scene is meant to be ambiguous.  It is meant to be mysterious or feel like it could be an illusion. The time and place are unclear. Why are they sitting in the snow? Whose footsteps are they really? Mido doesn't appear to have aged, but Dae-su definitely has grey hairs now

Anyway, as always, I enjoyed my time with the film.  There are 2 other commentaries available on the T.A.E. BD - one for Director & Cinematographer, and another for Director & Cast.  I will surely check one of those out next time.

2020-11-02,Parasite,2019,https://boxd.it/1rfptj,5,Yes,"Man, this felt like a different movie to me. It could just be the 3rd viewing, but the black & white treatment led my eyes to different  things, the score also stood out to me.","black-and-white, bd, criterion-collection",2020-11-01
2021-01-01,Parasite,2019,https://boxd.it/1yc7BL,5,Yes,"Viewed with commentary on the Criterion edition.  I took note of some things along that way that interested me:

* The spiral in the characters of the title is an idea of the poster designer, it mimics the idea of a parasite in the body
* All three living quarters are different sets
* The protagonists' (Kims') house and whole street is built in a water tank
* The fumigation is an important visual, the family is like an insect
* The pizza job and discussion about possible employment is foreshadowing of the competition families from this stratum are required to participate in
* Bong hates scholar stones because they are heavy. His father collected them. His father looked for them along streams, etc. They aren't really supposed to bring wealth, Bong made that part up
* Friendship between the rich and poor kids, in this case the boys is natural in Korea per Bong's experience. Kim Ki-Woo is sort of obsessed with Min
* Min, the rich boy invades the sub-basement without warning. It's natural to him
* Bong storyboarded everything. He has already edited everything in his mind and didn't film a bunch of extra shots or inserts. The detail he put into the storyboards included FPS of the shots, so the everyone knew where slow-motion or etc was going to be used.
* The fake diploma was to the university that Bong actually attended.  According to him they were friendly about being included
* <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/high-and-low/"">Kurosawa's High and Low (Heaven & Hell)</a> inspired Bong in its use of geographic differences between the rich & poor
* The second floor of the Park's house exterior is done with VFX
* The poor family always communicates and eats together, but in the case of the rich family you rarely see all 4 in the same frame.
* He wanted the housekeeper's visit in the rainy night to be in the middle of the film, so Bong needed to keep things very precise and efficient. 
* Da-song actually has no interest in Native Americans, they just enjoy it for being historical, and they consider it ""fancy"". The Natives also represent someone who ""already lived there""
* The rich daughter is seeking affection due to lack of familial love.
* The schizophrenia zone is based on something, but every painting has a corner, so the poor daughter Jessica is really a genius who probably just googled something about it.
* Bong's last name has some meaning in USA, but he didn't know. The distribution company gave him a real bong as a promotional gift for The Host, and he had a hard time in the airport as a result.
* Bong's depiction of the rich husband and wife was to look cool, but its also very uncomfortable. There's a clear hierarchy. 
* Casting:  Bong started with <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/actor/song-kang-ho/"">Song Kang-ho</a> (poor father), <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/actor/choi-woo-shik-1/"">Choi Woo-shik</a> (poor son), and <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/actor/lee-jung-eun/"">Lee Jung-eun</a> (original housekeeper) already in his mind since he worked with them in the past. He met <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/actor/park-so-dam/"">Park So-dam</a> (Jessica) during screenwriting. He felt her face looked like she was actually related to Choi Woo-shik. Casting the rich family came afterwards. 
* The hidden husband was hard to cast, he was last. Bong discovered him in an indie film. He was kept secret from journalists at first.
* The rich father's tech company is named ""Another brick"" due to Bong's childhood love of Pink Floyd.
* There's no exposition, everything is integrated into the storytelling. To achieve this Bong was very inspired by <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/mad-max-fury-road/"">George Miller's Fury Road</a>. It keeps going and it never stops.
* All the car scenes are shot as VFX with the actors sitting in a parked car.
* Some of Bong's friends and family live in semi-basements. He knows that smell quite intimately. 
* For the long conversation among the Kims before the original housekeeper returns, Bong liked how actors did in different takes.  He had the VFX team assemble different takes for the conversation without cutting the scene. The VFX team was able to make composite shots of the takes he wants.
* For the family's descent into the hidden basement, the team used the same VFX as <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance/"">Birdman</a> to combine the two different sets in one shot.
* The Taiwanese cupcake shop has a context in South Korea. Some years ago there was a trend with folks who lost their job to try opening a Taiwan cake shop - almost all of which failed. Now Taiwanese cupcakes are a symbol of the economic failure of ordinary people. 
* When the original housekeeper is directing the Kims to keep quiet and talking about launching nuclear missiles, she is imitating a specific North Korean news anchor who is very iconic.
* Record player was always part of the original design. It is important to the rich family to show off the classy and artistic nature.
* Ram-don is actually real and popular in Korea, even across generations. The one thing Bong added was sirloin for the rich people version.
* The discussion of sex and drugs are related to their illicit desires. The smell of poverty reminds him of the car and car sex.
* Regarding The theme of planning: For poor folks it's almost impossible to plan things due to lack of control of various factors. For rich people its generally easy to make a plan and realize it.
* The gym is the same location used for the quarantine in <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-host/"">The Host</a>. Bong didn't recognize it at first until his location scout informed him.
* The movie has a total of 998 shots, almost 450 are invisible VFX shots. This came about due to the cost and logistics of separate sets. For example, half of the trees in the rich family garden are VFX since those types of trees are actually really expensive.
* The design of the hidden basement: Bong was inspired by a documentary he saw about a pedophile in Austria who kept a hidden basement (!!!)
* The news broadcasts at the end are done by known journalists that Korean viewers recognize. 
* The thinking behind B/W version: Its a dream to make a B/W version as a cinephile. Bong couldn't suppress his own desire to have a B/W version, and the DP had a similar dream. The budget required was pretty low also.
* According to Bong's estimation, the son would have to work 547 years as a working class person to save up and buy the house which makes the ending a really sad fantasy.
* Bong is working on his next script!
* Winning the Oscar was never in the plan.
* Recording of commentary was done remotely during COVID-19 lockdown.

This is the type of movie you would subject someone to as punishment. A slog through a shitty relationship that ends in a blind date with a plastic bear head.

2021-08-01,The Green Knight,2021,https://boxd.it/22aZgD,,,"I first saw the trailer for The Green Knight in March of 2020 preceding <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-invisible-man-2020/"">The Invisible Man</a>. The otherworldly and serious, almost ominous, tone really resonated with me. ""Summer,"" the trailer promised, followed by the familiar and welcome logo of A24. I settled into my recliner, equal parts excited to see Elizabeth Moss deal with some invisible asshole, and for the promise of summer when I could revisit a childhood favorite: Sir Gawain and The Green Knight. Albeit, sans <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/sword-of-the-valiant-the-legend-of-sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight/"">sparkly Sean Connery</a>.

Well, little did I know that much like Sir Gawain, our collective honor and chivalry was about to be tested like I had never known. The week following The Invisible Man, folks started to realize that COVID was a very real threat. I spent hours at the mall looking for hand sanitizer to take on my business trip. The company I was on site for doing consulting shut down travel while I was there. The whole world suddenly felt upside down.

Fast forward a year and I'm re-watching the trailer in anticipation of the release.  Seeing the Green Knight, an unkillable force of nature, tell Sir Gawain ""one year hence,"" I couldn't help but feel a certain parallel to the last year.  His menacing bellowing laugh echoing through the streets as well as my mind. If only someone could have told us how long we'd have to buckle down, maybe we could have done better.

I felt sad watching Sir Gawain as he tried to navigate each situation.  He wants honor, he wants to be good, but when given a chance, he can never quite seem to do the right thing.  Whether failing to show gratitude, expecting things in return for helping someone in need, or refusing to keep his promises, it all felt relevant in a way.  This is exactly what we have witnessed over the past year with folks who think they can simply deny the reality of our situation and the possibilities destiny may have for us.

Finally, after a long strange journey, when faced with the reality of his destiny, he flinches. Annoyed, the Green Knight reminds him, ""You had a year to prepare."" Gawain almost can't believe it, like a COVID denier on his deathbed he was able to get away with acting the way he has until now. Wild-eyed, Gawain asks ""Is this all there is?"" And with a resounding finality the Green Knight, responds ""What else could there be?"" 

Is Gawain able to face his destiny? Can we? Can enough of us? What else could there be, for us?  

Personally, I found the movie beautiful and strange in a way; in a good way. I will admit that despite my laser-like focus, I couldn't understand about 25% of what was said on screen.  I look forward to seeing this again, with subtitles, and maybe with COVID less on my mind.","theatrical, regal-unlimited, a24, post-credits-scene, yir2021",2021-07-30

I found myself grinning as the opening credits started with the gothic red font splayed across Dracula's castle! It's not quite October, but it is Hooptober, and I live in a perpetual season of horror - COVID-19 notwithstanding. 

This film uses characters from Bram Stoker's Dracula but the plot is all its own as far as I can tell... granted I haven't read Dracula for some 25 years. Anyway, I found the familiar characters gave me a basic understanding of what to expect, except perhaps Jonathan's fate. 

Overall I found this one a bit shallow, though things do escalate at the end. Maybe vampire mythos have developed a lot since this came out, and as a result I found myself wanting more. Yes yes, garlic, crosses, yes we know. Oh to see this in 1958! 

I did like the makeup and special effects. The little bumps on Jonathan's neck, the burning of the crucifix on Lucy's forehead, and the burned ashes of Dracula's face with his eyeballs peering out! Wow.

I'm a little bummed that Dracula could be taken out like that, but now I can't wait to see the sequels, haha.

I liked the costumes and makeup, especially that of the mummy. The mummy's look maintains a line of continuity from when the bandages were fresh, then aged, then soiled, until eventually there are bullet holes and battle damage! Very cool. 

I found that I sympathized with Kharis/The Mummy the most. His actions were driven by love whereas the other characters were driven by financial gain or revenge. It's a shame he couldn't live with his beloved priestess forever - but we also don't know how she feels about him.

If there are sequels from Hammer I will certainly give them a try.

At first I thought maybe the team was just really having a good time with it, but now I'm thinking there is a theme with the eyes. I can't say I fully understood what it is, but it made for some entertaining and memorable deaths.

That being said, not only does this  one not shy away from onscreen violence and gore, they really take it to next level. I bet if I saw this on VHS or in lower fidelity I would not have been able to discern when the real ended and the prosthetics or movie magic started. It is definitely pretty awesome in that regard.

I can't say I saw the final act coming, at all.  Granted, the plot seems to take a backseat compared to the other creepy elements.  I couldn't help but wonder if this may have been the inspiration for Hideo Kojima's concept of ""The Beach"" in Death Stranding.

Another thing I really liked were the weird and interesting characters. Everybody on screen has their own weird thing.  Even characters that don't otherwise serve the plot, like the bookshop owner, or the records office clerk contribute to the sense of uneasy weirdness. Very cool.

I can't wait to see this one again.

I found a few of the makeup & special effects scenes to be really satisfying, which can go a long way to smooth over some other silly elements. There is a scene with an eyeball at one point which started triggering my PTSD from seeing The Beyond the other day. 

I found the coroner's idea that dead people are better was kind of interesting, even if it's not explored very much in the film itself. In fact, I think the benefits from not trying to invent and explain some kind of voodoo mumbo-jumbo reason for how he is able to do what he does keep it from going too far off the rails.

Things start out pretty predictable, but when Vincent Price starts handing out handguns in tiny coffins as party favors I have to admit I got interested. It held my attention well enough despite most aspects of it being pretty simple.  The ending clenched it for me.

Should I have seen the colorized version?  It felt really good in black & white, so I feel good about that pick.  I may try the colorized version if I go back to this one.

Here we are, 20 some years later, and even if the robot apocalypse doesn't feel any closer - I've gained a perspective on a world designed to give us paltry comforts and keep us busy all while using us up.
