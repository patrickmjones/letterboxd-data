In 2 mins she goes through: crowning, delivery, placenta, stitches, infant CPR, and the ""we did everything we could"" speech. It felt like a Monty Python sketch, and out of place. 

That aside, still a very enjoyable experience. Reminded me of ""Oro, Plata, Mata.""","netflix, black-and-white",2018-12-30

In exploring his work I landed on this because it was available via Netflix.

A beautiful slow burn within which the trio of leads really shine. Steven Yeun with that damned smug smile, haha. And let's not forget that truck Jong-su drove, it was a character all its own.

Set against the backdrop of the second EDSA revolution we see Vanessa trying to navigate caring for her mentally challenged sister following the death of her mother.

2019-09-19,In Between Mountains And Oceans,2014,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/in-between-mountains-and-oceans/,,,"This kind of strays from the building of the Ise Jingu shrine itself, but goes on to show how they care for the forest. The rebuilding of the shrine is contrasted with the upkeep done at the 1000+ year old Hōryū-ji temple, showcasing traditional Japanese architecture and construction techniques. The doc is interspersed with interviews with artists, carpenters, activists, and more including the great Takeshi Kitano. 

Masaaki Miyazawa's photography is beyond beautiful. It is supposedly the first Japanese documentary shot in 4k - I wish I'd seen it in 4k, but the streaming version on Amazon is still stunning. 

Quite relaxing and beautiful, with a fitting score. Definitely worth the watch in my opinion.",amazon-prime,2019-09-18
2019-09-20,Walrus Yes: The Making of Tusk,2019,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/walrus-yes-the-making-of-tusk/,,,"I'm not a listener of SMODcast and really only saw Tusk on a late night whim. I thought it was horrifying in the best way, an effect perhaps amplified by the fact I went in blind. I'm one of those people that liked it.

Fast forward past Smith's widowmaker and Yoga Hosers to today and #WalrusYes. The doc starts with a bit of pre-production and then is structured basically as a daily diary of the 15 day shoot. It is interspersed with board games, a birthday cake, and other behind the scenes bits.

I found the bits we see of how Kevin is sometimes Jay's big brother to be interesting and their shared silliness genuine. Also, Kevin is endlessly generous with his praise, optimism, and overall enjoyment on set which is heartwarming in a way. This optimism is reflected in the crew and folks seem to be enjoying the work.

Overall I found it enjoyable to watch right after work and it made me laugh - which isn't always easy.",youtube,2019-09-20

2019-10-24,Nosferatu,1922,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/nosferatu/,,,"I started with the 80 minute version included with Amazon Prime because, well, it is free - which is pretty rough all around (scratched dirty print, cropped title cards, characters renamed in the title cards, missing footage, etc.). I switched over to the Kino restored version which includes some missing and lost scenes as well as an orchestral soundtrack. The picture on the restored one is several orders of magnitude better, however there was noticable interlacing anytime there's fast motion, at least on Amazon Prime.

Overall was creepy and fun. Nothing I could say would be more informative or interesting than decades of reviews and analysis already out there. Reminder to check which version you're watching before starting.","amazon-prime, black-and-white",2019-10-23

2019-12-24,Cats,2019,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/film/cats-2019/,,,"The temptation to see this before any sort of patch was too great. Theoretically this version will never appear on streaming or disc, so I went out immediately. 

That being said about the patch, I don't think my complaints beyond it looking silly, especially the hands, are dependent on any sort of patch. In addition to that, I've never seen the stage musical so I'm not sure where the film stops and the stage play begins.

The practically nonexistent plot gives way to a series of musical dance numbers, which itself is an interesting idea. The problem for me was two-fold: 

1. The songs are mostly nonsensical. This may not be an issue per se, but when paired with #2 makes the movie mostly bad CG cats with human faces looking at the screen.

2. Camera and editing that minimizes the dancing! This part kills me because, at least theoretically in my mind, cat-like agility and dance-like movement could lend itself to some really beautiful choreography. It was almost all swallowed up with waist-up closeups and quick cuts that never give the choreography time to shine.  If the choreography was prioritized then the songs may have had more mpact. 

I wasn't exactly expecting The Red Shoes, but we've come so far technology-wise that this movie is borderline criminal.

On the upside, 2 of the songs were enjoyable and I could see them being moving outside of the film, but then again those songs were probably there in the original? I'm sure someone knows.

Ultimately I couldn't recommend this, I'd suggest seeing one of the televised or recorded stage productions instead... and I haven't even seen them.","theatrical, pre-patch, regal-unlimited",2019-12-23
