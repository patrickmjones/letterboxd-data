For details read <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/cinemonster/list/hooptober-ocho-the-only-way-to-stop-a-bad/"">Cinemonster's Hooptober Ocho: The Only Way to Stop a Bad Guy with a Chainsaw is a Good Guy with a Chainsaw</a>.

As usual, I have my own stipulations on top of the rules.
<blockquote>
 1) I'd like to keep it to movies I haven't already seen, and 
 2) Due to changing availability of some films on streaming services, I might have to swap one or more out for something else.</blockquote>
