1,Better Days,2019,https://boxd.it/l9Ke,"In this “gripping, superbly performed melodrama” (Jessica King, Variety), Nian finds her life at a standstill when faced by relentless bullying from her peers as she prepares for her college entrance exam. Fate brings her together with small-time criminal Bei, but before they can retreat into a world of their own, both are dragged into the middle of a murder investigation that will change their lives forever. In this dramatic thriller, Derek Kwok-Cheung Tsang paints a bleak picture of an oppressive society in the guise of a gripping fairy-tale love story, exposing the dark world of bullying and societal pressures of achievement facing today’s youth."
2,Chasing Dream,2019,https://boxd.it/mw8u,"One of Hong Kong’s most prolific and successful directors for four decades. Johnnie To makes a triumphant – if surprising –&nbsp; return to filmmaking after a three-year hiatus with Chasing Dream. Far from the gritty action films that made his name, this feel-good romp is the story of two young strivers: MMA fighter Tiger and aspiring singer Cuckoo. They first meet when Tiger’s crooked manager sends him to collect a debt from Cuckoo, but they soon strike up a friendship as he tries to earn enough money to open a restaurant, while she seeks revenge on the television host who stole her songs by showing up at auditions for his gaudy, American Idol-like reality show, Perfect Diva. To’s signature stylish direction and propulsive pacing are evident throughout."
3,Fagara,2019,https://boxd.it/mWB8,"After her father dies, a Hong Kong girl discovers she has two hitherto unknown sisters, one in Taiwan and one in China. To settle her father's debt, she must reunite with them to run the family's hot pot restaurant. While the androgynous Taiwan sister is plagued by her toxic relationship with her mother, the fashionista sister from China is trying to fend off her grandmother's pressure to get married. Meanwhile, she is striving to unshackle herself from her ex-boyfriend in order to start a new relationship. The latest film from writer/director Heiward Mak, who appeared in person at a previous Made in Hong Kong Film Festival with her film Diva, is, according to Edmund Lee of the South China Morning Post, “one of the best Hong Kong films of recent times.”"
4,Line Walker 2: Invisible Spy,2019,https://boxd.it/lGBO,"“Action fans should be thrilled,” declared Edmund Lee in the South China Morning Post. “This is one of the best Hong Kong films of 2019.” In this action spectacle, a car crash sparks a war between local police and an international terrorist organization. After Superintendent Yip (Francis Ng) and Inspector Ching (Nick Cheung) arrest a hacker named Yiu involved in the accident, the two police officers are suspected by Superintendent Cheng (Louis Koo) as double agents. Clues lead the three officers to the far foreign soil of Myanmar and Spain, but as the investigation continues, the lines between who is good and who is evil become blurred. This sequel to the critically acclaimed and box-office smashing Line Walker (2016), starring three award-winning actors, continues to explore the emotional world of heavyweight police action. Its bonkers final car chase, set during the running of the bulls in Pamplona, is not to be missed!"
5,Twilight's Kiss,2019,https://boxd.it/nn8i,"Twilight’s Kiss presents the story of two closeted married men in their twilight years. One day Pak, 70, a taxi driver who refuses to retire, meets Hoi, 65, a retired single father, in a park. Despite years of societal and personal pressure, they are proud of the families they have created through hard work and determination. Yet in that brief initial encounter, something is unleashed in them which had been suppressed for so many years. As both men recall their personal histories, they also contemplate a possible future together. Inspired by an oral history of older gay men in Hong Kong, Ray Yeung’s film looks inside a closeted world rarely seen on film. Wendy Ide of Screen International praised it as “a delicate little wisp of a romance which plays out in fragile moments and shared glances.”&nbsp;"
6,A Witness Out of the Blue,2019,https://boxd.it/nkDW,"When a mysterious killer starts picking off members of a crime gang one by one, the police suspect a connection to a jewelry heist masterminded by a ruthless crime boss (Sean Wong). But their only lead is a witness to one of the murders: a talking parrot. This crowd-pleasing blend of whodunnit, comedy, and melodrama features an excellent ensemble cast, including Cherry Ngan, Louis Cheung, and Louis Koo."
