2019-08-21,Addicted to That Special Sense of Dread,horror,https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/list/addicted-to-that-special-sense-of-dread/,"For the uninitiated, horror films may simply mean zombies or slashers.  The truth is, there are many types of horror flicks. To help folks explore, I've put together the following list.
There's no Freddy Kreuger here, he's in plenty of other lists I'm sure, but there is plenty of variation, and most are from the 2010s. 
If you've seen one we should check out, add it in the comments.  
* All movies on the list are listed as ""horror"" on letterboxd, and are in no particular order."
