South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho is the director of The Host (2006), Mother (2009), and Snowpiercer (2013). We interviewed him for our release of the classic South Korean film The Housemaid, available in the World Cinema Project box set. After we asked him to name his favorite titles in the collection, he told us, “I actually ended up writing a wish list of Criterion Blu-rays I would like to own. For an insatiable collector like myself, limiting myself to ten films was torture.”</blockquote>
