2020-08-27,Hooptober Se7en: We Have Such Masked Socially Distanced Indoor Sights to Show You,"yir2020, hooptober, hooptober7.0, hoop-tober, horror",https://boxd.it/8rj3g,"This is my first Hooptober.  For details read <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/cinemonster/list/hooptober-se7en-we-have-such-masked-socially/"">Cinemonster's Hooptober Se7en List</a>.

Putting together the list has been a little tricky.  
 1) I'd like to keep it to movies I haven't already seen, and 
 2) I'm trying to put together a list of movies I know I have access to (or will have access to when the time comes).  

Due to these stipulations on my part I may need to change a few movies around depending on availability over the course of October.
