2019-10-24,https://boxd.it/QBGQ1,"That clown seemed familiar, so I checked and the movie Netflix keeps recommending to me called ""Terrifier"" must be part 3 or a related spin-off.

There are a lot of decent to good horror flicks out there, but it all comes down to having access and being in the mood. If you're looking, I can recommend everything on <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/list/addicted-to-that-special-sense-of-dread/"">this list I made</a>, and/or if you end up seeing the sequel, I'd be interested in hearing what you think."
2020-01-11,https://boxd.it/WaQU3,I really liked it the first time around and am looking forward to a second viewing even more so now.
2020-04-11,,Cool way to keep track. Now I feel compelled to do the same. Stay safe
2020-08-27,https://boxd.it/7phpm,I'm definitely joining this year. I'll work on my list and post it soon.

Good luck and have fun! ⚰️"
2020-09-29,https://boxd.it/1nrmAz,Nice! Was looking for a replacement body horror flick for one I'd seen on my list - I think this is it.  
2020-10-28,https://boxd.it/8rj3g,"Well, when I planned my Hooptober both Tetsuo II: Body Hammer, and Dawn of the Dead were available to stream, however, now that I'm getting to them they don't seem to be available.  I may need to call an audible on those two for now, or commit to seeing them later when I can.  Otherwise, so far so good."

What a fitting end to 2020."
2021-06-16,https://boxd.it/1VCzTx,"I kept seeing it on my Netflix, and after seeing you log it I finally pulled the trigger. Was cool to see Peter Outerbridge, though he seemed underutilized here - I really liked him in that show ReGenesis."
2021-07-22,https://boxd.it/20KQkZ,I saw this back in the day and really liked it but got the sense I was alone in that. Glad to hear it holds up. I'll have to try tracking down this release and giving it a rewatch!
2021-09-22,https://boxd.it/cDGlW,My second Hooptober! https://letterboxd.com/patrickmjones/list/hooptober-ocho-the-only-way-to-stop-a-bad/
2021-10-14,https://boxd.it/2c3wYR,"That's a shame, this looked interesting"
2021-12-31,https://boxd.it/2pPHp7,"Enjoy the journey! My set came this week too, and I'm very excited to dive in!"
